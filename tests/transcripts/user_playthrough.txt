You are in an open field west of a big white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a mailbox here.

>EAST
You are behind the white house. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is open.

>OPEN WINDOW
With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

> ENTER WINDOW
You are in the kitchen. On a table is a nasty-looking knife.
There is a small bag here. A clear glass bottle is here.

You are in the living room. The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to take it you have noticed an irregularity beneath it.

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room. With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap-door appears.

>OPEN TRAP DOOR
Opened.

>DOWN
You are in the cellar.

>EAST
You are in a small room with passages off in all directions. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls. A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.

>KILL TROLL WITH KNIFE
You strike the troll and it falls to the ground, unconscious. All passages out of the room are open.

>TAKE AXE
Taken.

>SOUTH
You are in a narrow east-west passageway. There is a narrow stairway leading down at the north end of the room.

>SOUTH
You are in a large circular room with passages off in eight directions. Your compass needle spins wildly, and you can't get your bearings.

You are in a winding passage. It seems that there is only an exit on the east end although the whirring from the round room can be heard faintly to the north.

>WEST
You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a coal mine. On the south wall of the chamber the letters "Granite Wall" are etched in the rock. To the east is a long passage and there is a steep metal slide twisting downward. From the appearance of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible. To the north is a small opening.

>DOWN
You are in the cellar.

You are in a long passage. To the south is one entrance. On the east there is an old wooden door, with a large hole in it (about cyclops sized).

Taken.

>NORTH
You are in a north-south crawlway. A passage goes to the east also.

>EAST
You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here. At the north and northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint). An extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down.

You are in the Troll Room.

>TAKE ZORKMID
Taken.

>WEST
A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says 'I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on trespassers, but for a small fee, I'll show you the way out.' You notice the gnome nervously glancing at his watch. [act2.27, 372]

>GIVE ZORKMID TO GNOME
Thank you very much for the zorkmid. 'Follow me', he says, and a door appears on the west end of the ledge. Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney sloping steeply downward.

You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably for the royal family. All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed to pieces by unfriendly gnomes. To the north is an exit. [dung.56, 390]
